# TremEngine

Trem Engine is (will be) a 2D game engine.

As of now, the engine exists in a preliminary alpha state and is capable of rendering quads with a texture and changing the transform of these quads (move, rotate, scale).

At this time, TremEngine is not meant to be a commercially used platform, at least not in terms of prominent and famous game engines. It is merely meant as a framework (a set of functionality) which i can use to develop games.<br>
Nevertheless, if people join me in the development of TremEngine, we could expand it's purpose  to be used in commercial endeavors.

The repository includes premake files for the repository and external dependencies to create a Visual Studio solution.

I want to thank The Cherno for his inspiration to write this game engine. His YouTube series gave me the motivation to start making my own engine.

Trem Engine depends on the following libaries.
