Trem Engine is (will be) a 2D game engine.

As of now, the engine exists in a preliminary alpha state and is capable of rendering quads with a texture and changing the transform of these quads (move, rotate, scale).

The initial commit is meant to define an alpha version, on which i can expand and improve the engine.

The repository includes premake files for the repository and external dependencies to create a Visual Studio solution.

I want to thank The Cherno for his inspiration to write this game engine. His YouTube series gave me the motivation to start making my own engine.

Trem Engine depends on the following libaries.
